          The dawn of the digital age has transformed the way businesses operate and market themselves. As e-commerce and online presence become increasingly crucial for business success, the role of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and digital marketing tools has become paramount. However, the accessibility of these tools varies greatly across different regions of the world, creating a digital divide that threatens to exacerbate existing economic inequalities.
